# Overview
This is an Excel file for the list of courses I am taking on Udemy. I plan to create a dashboard and for it to be searchable with filters once I
learn this functionality.

# Why did I take that XYZ course?

1. Microsoft Excel 2016 Master Class: Beginner to Avanced

## Notes

I took this course to learn more about Excel than I know now. Bruce is very good at what he knows and is practical and leads by example. I plan
to create several dashboards with this, including inventory, Point of Sale, and finacial reports.

2. The Guide to Freelancing in The Modern Gig Economy

## Notes

While I have a part-time job, I am "gearing up," so that I can specialize in the "Gig Economy" that is expanding. Also, because I do not do this at my
current job, I want to gain as much experience as I can creating spreadsheets (i.e. and databases in the future). You have to crawl before you walk!

3. The Complete Financial Analyst Course 2023

## Notes

This course will help me understand financial analysis. I know this is a highly regulated industry and hope to learn the regulations necessary to create my own POS Dashboard and hopefully, database and full application. This is something I always wanted to do. There are many terms I need to know
that I can putinside the dashboard and POS to do this. This will be an interesting project to do!

4. Drupal From Basics to Advance with 3 Live Projects

## Notes

This is a course I need that I will be using Drupal for a complex booking app project that is needed. Drupal has a more friendly eco-system for
developers and I want to learn this system for that reason. I will be learning these systems to become an expert in CMS. Later, I intend to master
web frameworks! And in the future, I am consdiering creating my own CMS / framework for my own projects and will share that on GitHub.
Please note: This is not to compete with Trongate, Laravel, CakePHP (and so on) web frameworks.
